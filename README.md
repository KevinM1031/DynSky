# DynSky

The DynSky is a unique clock in that it displays time through an image of a land/skyscape. These images are completely procedurally generated and updates in real-time, based on local weather and other notable events such as eclipses and comets. Instead of a realistic look, an art style similar to cartoon or anime will be used, alongside several experimental rendering methods which will theoretically be more efficient than conventional raycasting/tracing. The challenge is to create a 1500px by 1000px dynamic image with at most 4GB RAM CPU and without a GPU, while maintaining at least 10 FPS.
